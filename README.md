# Challenge for GetAround

If I had more time I would have improved, for the level 5 :
- Add specs and improve existing ones (add spec for controller, ...),
- Go further in the creation of object for example create `RentalOptionPrice` class to handle specific case of option price,
- Improve existing method such as `compute_decreasing_price`,
- Make rubocop pass for all the levels (only the 2 first ones for this case)
